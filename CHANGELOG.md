[English](CHANGELOG.md) | [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh.md)

## 1.2.0 - 2026-10-10

- Redesign Tasks with Skill imports / Skill updates tabs, a task list and a details pane. Keep the existing theme, add title/help/cleanup icons, and retain selections across tabs. Start checks from the main toolbar; closing the dialog keeps tasks running.
- Default update results to actionable changes. Show separate Failed, Updated, Unchanged and Ignored filters, with All last; remove the update-results search field. Confirm source deletions, support individual failed-check retries and dismissal, and preserve skill files when deleting records.
- Clear previous reports when starting a full repository check; preserve other repositories during scoped checks. Clear finished records within the current tab while retaining active batches and unresolved failures.
- Move GitHub imports to the background when the Add Skills dialog loses focus. Continue name-conflict resolution from Tasks, retry failures, cancel downloads and preparation, and let atomic commits finish safely. Allow stopping orphaned tasks and deleting stopping records without releasing active-write locks early.
- Speed up large-repository imports and updates by reusing bounded immutable snapshots, importing selected skills together at the previewed commit, resolving revisions once per update batch, revalidating only target skills, and refreshing lists once after a batch.
- Recognize root skills moved into repository subdirectories, fixing false source-deleted results such as last30days. Successful checks refresh displayed check times without changing skill files.
- Put the persisted grouped/flat view switch after Open directory in every skill toolbar. Add a sortable Repository column and owner/repository or repository@owner formats in flat view. Add configurable F3 view switching and F5 refresh; retain expansion shortcuts without the expand-all header icon.
- Preserve each view's scroll position, align sidebar and workspace headers/footers, and improve text contrast. Remove extra backgrounds from disabled inputs, tags, sidebar counts and inspector metadata; selected tags use the theme highlight color.
- Refresh bilingual usage documentation and screenshots for grouped/flat browsing, imports, bundles, update actions and both Tasks tabs, using fictional data.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-23

- Add an Update skills confirmation dialog with Last results, Check updates, Update stars and Cancel. Refresh repository stars independently, with progress and retries in background tasks.
- Show Update status and check timestamps in the status bar. Move Delete & reimport to the footer and apply selected replacements separately from regular updates.
- Toggle repository names between owner/repository and repository@owner, sorting by the displayed name. Place format and expand/collapse controls on the right of the name header.
- Append and deduplicate AI tag suggestions while preserving existing tags. Fix notes and tags save/clear buttons changing together.
- Dismiss search scope filters on focus loss, outside clicks or Escape.
- Unify common action icons and show platform-specific icons in Settings. Refine background task layout and manual stop, retry and cleanup controls.
- Preserve repository stars and cache timestamps in local and WebDAV backups, with support for older backups. Add star counts to directory CSV exports.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-22

- Unify GitHub and local imports, simplify the import wizard, and distinguish add, update and refresh with icon-only buttons and tooltips.
- Add collapsible repositories, status filters, a resizable update dialog, selected-repository checks and footer retries for failed checks; serialize checks and writes within each repository.
- Detect overwrite conflicts by the actual destination, avoiding false conflicts for matching IDs in different repositories; preserve destination IDs on reimport.
- Validate content versions before applying updates and accept retries of completed additions or updates. Group replacement candidates under remote deletions with a Delete and reimport action.
- Add tag renaming, deletion, batch drag-and-drop assignment, filter clearing, notes editing and configurable search scopes.
- Add custom platform icons, sidebar management and counts, plus context-sensitive status statistics.
- Add Ctrl+F search focus and Esc to clear and leave search; refresh bilingual documentation and feature screenshots.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-18

- Release SkillsHub 1.0.0 with a skill resource library, collections, a central skills directory, and installation management for platforms and projects.
- Support skill imports, updates from source repositories, AI explanations, and backups.
- Improve Git ignore rules to exclude build caches, local application data, and key files.
